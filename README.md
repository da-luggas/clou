# Clou - Apple Books highlight exporter written in Swift
Since Apple removed the ability to bulk export the highlights and notes you create within the Apple Books application, third-party options have to be used to perform this simple task. A very effective solution is **Clou**, the easy-to-use and macOS native Apple Books highlights exporter.

## Functionality
- Choose one or multiple books at once
- Copy selected highlights to clipboard
- Bulk export to CSV

## Installation
1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/da-luggas/clou/releases)
2. Extract the archive
3. Drag the app into your Applications folder
4. Allow the app to access other app's folders as well as iCloud. This is needed to access the Apple Books library

## Planned for the future
- Export into different formats (e.g. Readwise, Excel)
- Automatic updates using Sparkle
- Automated synchronization of bookmarks with third party apps
- More ideas? Create an issue :)
